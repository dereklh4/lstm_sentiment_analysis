Dependencies:
Tensorfow version 1.1

Note:
This code makes use of pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe, found here (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) but downloaded from the tutorial github. We use the one with 400,000 word vectors, each with a dimensionality of 50. They need to placed in the "embeddings" folder as "wordsList.npy" and "wordVectors.npy"
